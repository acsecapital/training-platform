# Course Progress Calculation Fix

This document outlines the changes made to fix the course progress calculation issues.

## Problem

The course progress calculation had multiple issues:

1. Multiple sources of truth for progress calculation
2. Inconsistent logic across different parts of the application
3. The `isCompleted` flag was incorrectly used to force 100% display
4. Potential for desynchronization between different parts of the application

## Solution

We've implemented a centralized approach to progress calculation:

1. Created a single, authoritative calculation function in `courseProgressService.ts`
2. Updated all progress-related utilities to use this centralized function
3. Fixed the sync logic to ensure consistency across all parts of the application
4. Separated display logic from calculation logic

## Key Changes

1. Added `calculateCourseProgress` function in `courseProgressService.ts`
2. Updated `syncCourseProgress.ts` to use the correct logic
3. Fixed `fixEnrollmentProgress.ts` to use the correct logic
4. Updated admin override utilities to use the centralized calculation
5. Created `progressCalculation.ts` with display utilities
6. Updated UI components to use the correct display logic

## Implementation Details

The core principle is:
- Progress is calculated as: `(completedLessons.length / totalLessons) * 100`
- A course is marked as completed if and only if all required lessons are completed
- The `completed` flag is used for styling and status, not to alter the displayed progress percentage

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Complete some lessons in a course and check that the progress is consistent across all pages
2. Complete all lessons in a course and verify it shows as 100% completed
3. Have an admin mark a course as completed and verify it behaves correctly
4. Add a new lesson to a completed course and verify the progress updates correctly
