# Training Platform Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
This document outlines the plan to develop a comprehensive training platform to replace the existing closercollegett.com system. The new platform will be built as a separate module that can eventually be integrated with the main Sales Coach AI application.

## Business Objectives
- Replace the current systeme.io-hosted training website
- Create a self-contained training delivery system
- Enable direct certificate downloads (replacing email delivery)
- Implement manager notifications for training completion
- Build a scalable framework for adding new training courses
- Integrate with existing Stripe payment infrastructure
